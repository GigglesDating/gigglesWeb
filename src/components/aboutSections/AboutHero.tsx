        <p className='text-center font-karla text-[0.9rem]'>Human beings are inherently social creatures, evolving through our connections with others. In countries like the US and UK, striking up a conversation with a stranger is effortless, but in India, this ease is often lacking. This highlights a need for better socialization tools, not just dating platforms. Despite the abundance of over 100 dating apps—ranging from those focused on marriage, casual dating, and even hookups—there isn’t a single platform dedicated purely to forming platonic companionships.</p>
        <p className='text-center font-karla text-[0.9rem]'>When people feel lonely, they often turn to dating apps, but the widespread belief that dating must lead to something intimate has overshadowed the simple joy of finding genuine companionship.</p>
